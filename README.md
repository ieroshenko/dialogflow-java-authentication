Sharing an example of how to setup DialogFlow V2 Authentication programmatically with Java

This is an example of code I used for creating a chat-bot using Dialogflow for my Software Engineering project at 
Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Java 11 was used at the time.

Note: JSON file with the API key didn't work for me as well as for some people on the internet, so instead you will need to copy the API key into a .txt file.

Implementation was made thanks to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55356542/dialogflow-authentication-programmatically-java
